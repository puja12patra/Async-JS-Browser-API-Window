    <h2>Browser APIs</h2>
    Browser APIs are sets of tools and functions provided by web browsers that developers can use to interact with web pages and browser features.
    <br> Here are some common Browser APIs along with brief explanations:
    <ol>
        <li><h4> DOM (Document Object Model) API:</h4>The DOM API provides a structured representation of HTML documents, allowing JavaScript to manipulate the content, structure, and style of web pages dynamically. Developers can use methods like getElementById, querySelector, createElement, etc., to interact with HTML elements.</li>
        <li><h4>Fetch API: </h4>The Fetch API provides an interface for fetching resources (like JSON, images, or documents) across the network asynchronously. It is a modern replacement for XMLHttpRequest and offers a more flexible and powerful way to make HTTP requests.</li>
        <li><h4>LocalStorage and SessionStorage:</h4> These APIs allow developers to store key-value pairs locally within the user's browser. LocalStorage persists data even after the browser is closed, while SessionStorage only persists for the duration of the page session.</li>
        <li><h4>Web Storage API:</h4> In addition to LocalStorage and SessionStorage, the Web Storage API includes the localStorage and sessionStorage objects. These objects provide methods like setItem, getItem, removeItem, and clear for managing stored data.</li>
        <li><h4>Geolocation API:</h4> The Geolocation API allows web applications to retrieve the user's geographical location (latitude and longitude) using various sources such as GPS, Wi-Fi, or IP address. This information can be used to provide location-based services or customize content based on the user's location.</li>
        <li><h4>IndexedDB API:</h4> IndexedDB is a low-level API for storing large amounts of structured data (such as JSON objects) in the user's browser. It provides a way to create, read, write, and delete data asynchronously, enabling offline web applications and efficient data management.</li>
        <li><h4>WebRTC API:</h4>WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication) enables real-time communication between web browsers, allowing features like peer-to-peer video/audio calling, file sharing, and screen sharing without the need for plugins or additional software.</li>
        <li><h4>Web Audio API:</h4>This API provides powerful tools for creating, processing, and manipulating audio in web applications. It enables features like playing audio files, synthesizing sound, applying effects, and creating complex audio workflows.</li>
        <li><h4>Canvas API:</h4>The Canvas API provides a way to dynamically generate graphics, charts, and animations within a web page using JavaScript. Developers can draw shapes, text, images, and manipulate pixels directly onto a canvas element.</li>
        <li><h4>Web Workers API:</h4> Web Workers allow JavaScript code to run in background threads, enabling concurrent execution and improving performance for tasks that are CPU-intensive or long-running. This helps prevent blocking the main UI thread and enhances responsiveness.</li>
    </ol>
