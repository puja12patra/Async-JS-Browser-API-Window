    <h2>Same-origin policy in the context of AJAX requests</h2>
    <p>The same-origin policy is a critical security mechanism that restricts how a document
        or script loaded by one origin can interact with a resource from another origin.
        <br>According to same-origin policy, scripts running in a browser are allowed to make requests to only same
        domain pages i,e. the request must have the same protocol,same host and same port number.
    </p>

    <p>
        There are scenarios where we might need to make AJAX requests to a different origin,
        for example, when integrating with third-party APIs or fetching data from a different server.
        In such cases, we can use techniques like Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) or
        JSONP to work around the same-origin policy.
    </p>
    However, there are several ways to work around the same-origin policy:
    <ul>
        <li>
            <h3>Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS):</h3>
            Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) is an extension of the same-origin policy. It can be used for
            authorized resource sharing with external third parties.
            For example, When we want to pull data from external APIs that are public or authorized, we need CORS.
            <br>It involves the server including specific HTTP headers
            in its responses to indicate which origins are allowed to access the resources. With
            CORS, the server can specify which HTTP methods (e.g., GET, POST) and headers are
            allowed in cross-origin requests.
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>JSONP (JSON with Padding): </h3>
            JSONP is a technique that allows cross-origin requests by
            exploiting the ability to include &lt;script&gt; tags from other domains. It works by
            requesting JavaScript code from a different domain that wraps the JSON response.
            While JSONP is easy to implement, it has security vulnerabilities and is limited to
            GET requests.
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Proxy Server:</h3>
            Another workaround is to set up a server-side proxy that forwards requests
            from the client to the desired destination. Since the proxy resides on the same origin as
            the client, it can make requests to other origins without being subject to the same-origin
            policy. The proxy server then forwards the response back to the client.
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Cross-Origin Communication Techniques: </h3>
            Techniques like window.postMessage() or
            Cross-Origin Messaging can be used for communication between different windows or iframes
            with different origins. These techniques allow secure communication between windows/frames
            hosted on different domains without violating the same-origin policy.
        </li>
    </ul>
    These methods provide developers with options to overcome the limitations imposed
    by the same-origin policy while ensuring security and compliance with web standards.
    However, it's essential to choose the appropriate workaround based on the specific
    requirements and security considerations of the application.
